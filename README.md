# Deforestation-Project
ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness  about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data was obtained from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and  year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.
